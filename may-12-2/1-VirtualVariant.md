Here are several other real-world business cases across different industries where the **Virtual $\rightarrow$ Variant** (Parent/Child) architecture is heavily utilized:

### 1. Apparel & Fashion (The Classic Use Case)
*   **Virtual**: "Classic Men's Oxford Shirt" (This is what you search for and click on).
*   **Variant**: "Navy Blue - Size Medium", "White - Size Large" (These are the actual physical SKUs that are picked from the warehouse and shipped).
*   *Why it fits*: The Virtual record holds the marketing description, the main photos, and the brand name. The Variant records hold the specific barcode, physical weight, and inventory count for that exact size/color combination.

### 2. Electronics & Gadgets
*   **Virtual**: "iPhone 15 Pro" 
*   **Variant**: "256GB - Natural Titanium", "512GB - Blue Titanium"
*   *Why it fits*: A customer doesn't just buy an "iPhone 15 Pro"—they must select the storage capacity and color. The pricing often differs at the Variant level (e.g., 512GB costs more than 256GB), but they all share the same Virtual parent page.

### 3. Travel & Ticketing (Airlines)
*   **Virtual**: "Flight Delta 102 (JFK to LHR)"
*   **Variant**: "Basic Economy", "Main Cabin", "Delta One (Business)"
*   *Why it fits*: The flight itself (the Virtual entity) has a single departure time and destination. However, the customer's actual entitlement and price (the Variant) depend on the cabin class selected.

### 4. Furniture & Home Decor
*   **Virtual**: "Mid-Century Modern Sofa"
*   **Variant**: "Walnut Legs - Velvet Emerald Green", "Oak Legs - Linen Beige"
*   *Why it fits*: Furniture often has customizable components. The Virtual product defines the overall shape and dimensions, while the Variants define the specific fabric and finish combinations the factory needs to build or the warehouse needs to stock.

### 5. Cosmetics & Beauty
*   **Virtual**: "SuperStay Matte Liquid Lipstick"
*   **Variant**: "Shade: Ruby Red", "Shade: Desert Nude", "Shade: Plum Perfection"
*   *Why it fits*: The chemical formula and packaging style are the same (Virtual), but the specific color pigment (Variant) is what the customer selects and what the inventory system tracks.

### 6. Food & Beverage (QSR/Coffee)
*   **Virtual**: "Caramel Macchiato"
*   **Variant**: "Tall - Whole Milk", "Grande - Oat Milk", "Venti - Almond Milk"
*   *Why it fits*: The recipe base is the Virtual product. The specific modifications that determine the final price and calorie count are the Variants.

### 7. B2B / Wholesale Hardware
*   **Virtual**: "Hex Head Steel Bolt"
*   **Variant**: "10mm Length - Box of 100", "15mm Length - Box of 500"
*   *Why it fits*: The item is essentially the same, but the dimensions and the packaging unit (which dictates the SKU and price) are the Variants.

### The "Rule of Thumb"
If you can ask the question **"Which one?"** after someone says they want to buy a product, it is a Virtual-Variant relationship. 
*   "I want to buy an Apple Watch." $\rightarrow$ *"Which size? Which band color?"* 
*   "I want to buy a T-Shirt." $\rightarrow$ *"Which size?"*
